# CSC331H-ProjectPart2

ProjectPart2

This is just a silly small project for Stack topic in data structures
(lazy mode) didn't create my own stack, used the one from STL and implemented the infix calculator.




also, there's a linking issue between header file and cpp everytime I implement a template in a class.
The only patch that works for my assembler is when I renamed the CPP to TPP and have it included at the bottom of the header file.
